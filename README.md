### Hi there! üëã

I'm a cutting-edge and forward-thinking developer passionate about crafting clean, modern code that drives companies toward their business objectives. With **over 7 years of extensive experience**, I've contributed my expertise in both front-end and back-end development across different projects in diverse industries.

My specialty lies in mastering technologies such as **React (including Context API, Relay GraphQL, Redux), Node.js, Next.js, CloudFlare (including workers) and a spectrum of AWS services (EC2, API Gateway, Lambda, Cognito, DynamoDB, CloudFront, Route53, CloudWatch, SES, SQS, SNS, CloudFormation, Translate, CDK, etc.)**. I'm adept at working with **MongoDB, Redis**, and relational databases and bring a foundation in mathematics to my problem-solving approach.

I've also created numerous integrations with payment systems such as Stripe, Paddle, and others, including crypto-payments. Additionally, I've integrated with OpenAI, and helpdesk services such as Intercom, HelpScout, Crisp, and Zendesk, along with Zapier and Make. I have experience working with KYC services like Veriff and ShuftiPro.

Furthermore, my skill set extends into **DevOps, utilizing AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, and Kubernetes** to ensure efficient operations. While I've previously worked with C# and PHP, my heart truly belongs to JavaScript.

üöÄ Let's connect and create remarkable solutions together! ‚ù§Ô∏è
